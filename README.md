# Uno R4
Quick test project for the new Uno R4 from the arduino.cc developers.

Using arduino-cli (running sway and wayland on Debian Bookworm for amd64 ;
the 1.8.19 IDE is misbehaving).

This test project runs fine as presented, on the Uno R3 of wokwi.com and so
it is expected to run well on the Uno R4 as well.
